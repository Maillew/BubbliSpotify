# BubbliSpotify
Bubbli Spotify, a fun website to share and compare your Spotify Data with friends! 

# Getting Started
- Due to requirements by Spotify for Developers, accounts have to be pre-approved before Bubbli is able to access their account information.
- Once approved, head over to ```Sign In``` or ```Your User``` to log in.
- From there, you can view your account data using the physics engine at ```Your User``` or you can compare your song data with your friends at ```Share Results```
